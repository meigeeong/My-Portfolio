Hi! I'm Mei Gee, combining my Biomedicine and Nutrition expertise with a newfound passion for data analysis. I'm currently focusing on mastering data analytic skills, including MySQL, Power BI, to bring data-driven insights to the different fields of studies including agriculture, sales etc. My GitHub repository is a collection of projects that highlight my journey and skills in data manipulation and visualization. I also have extensive experience with SPSS, where I conducted descriptive and inferential statistics to solve complex problems during my postgraduates studies.

### Statistical Analyses: 
#### Descriptive Statistics: Calculated measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance) to describe the main features of a dataset.
#### Inferential Statistics: Applied inferential techniques such as hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests) to draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.
#### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Used ANOVA to compare means across multiple groups and determine if there are statistically significant differences between them, include One-Way ANOVA and repeated measure ANOVA.
#### Data Visualisation: Created visualisations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to present data insights and trends clearly and effectively.
#### Non-parametric Tests: Used non-parametric statistical tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney U Test, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test) when data did not meet parametric assumptions.

# Summary of my MSc research
## Thesis Title: Pharmacognostic and antioxidant properties of Dracaena sanderiana leaves
### Finding summary: D. sanderiana leaves have the potential to be used as a natural antioxidant. The E60 fraction had the highest antioxidant activity.
