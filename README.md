Hi, I'm Roey! I came from Electronic background in Bachelor Degree and now on track to completing my Master in computer science. 

During my studies, I discovered that I have a great passion for technology,especially software-related field.The most significant impact came during coding lesson,where I felt like I was performing some kind of magic,being able to communicate with computers and create fastastic application like microcontroller,websites and graphical user interface Apps. 

In my final year, I chose to delve deeper by undertaking a project in FPGA because I wanted to gain a better understanding of the interface between software and hardware such as:

i) Digital Logic Design: Understanding how to design digital circuits using Verilog or VHDL, including combinational and sequential logic, finite state machines, and other digital components.

ii) FPGA Architecture and Tools: Familiarizing myself with the architecture of the FPGA i am using, as well as the development tools provided by the FPGA vendor (e.g.Intel Quartus Prime). This includes understanding synthesis, place and route, and timing analysis.

For more details on the final year project can refer to the Repository below.

- [FPGA UART controller using Altera Cyclone IV](https://github.com/Roey0204/FPGA-Controller)

After graduated, I join MNC company as UI-UX Engineer (2 years) and join Mechatronic System team to support Software relevant task (2 Years).

Throughout the years, I have developed a strong foundation through participate some project to build fundamental on object-oriented programming, microcontroller programming, data acquisition, data modeling, Internet of things, machine learning etc.
