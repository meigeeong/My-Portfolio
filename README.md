Hi! I'm Mei Gee, combining my biomedicine and nutrition expertise with a newfound passion for data analysis. I'm currently focusing on mastering MySQL, Power BI, Python to bring data-driven insights to the different fields of studies including agriculture, sales etc. My GitHub repository is a collection of projects that highlight my journey and skills in data manipulation and visualization. I also have extensive experience with SPSS, where I conducted descriptive and inferential statistics to solve complex problems during my postgraduates studies.
