# Summary of my phD research
## Thesis Title: Effect of combination of behavioural intervention and nutrition education with brown rice (COMBINE-BROWN) weight loss program on body composition and oxidative stress and among overweight and obese adults

### Phase I: The finding from Phase I reported a greater nutritional composition and elements content in brown rice than in white rice. 
### Phase II: Intermediate glycaemic index was reported for the rice varieties. 
### Phase III: Both test groups showed significant improvement (p<0.05) in weight loss, total body fat percentage, lipid profile, antioxidants level (GPX and GR), total physical activity and the scores of IWQOLLITE in the 12-week intervention period. The COMBINE-BR Group significantly reduced oxidative stress compared to the COMBINE Group, as shown by a significant reduction of TBARS biomarkers.
